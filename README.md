# Dank-Memer-Stealer

Once the ids in the program are specified, running this will cause all accounts on the user's device to join a server, share all of their dank memer coins with a certain user, and then leave the server.

The program will then print "your pretty"... "dumb" obviously you can change this script but it makes it seem that's all the program does - if the user chooses to then view the source of the program, it'll be edited to that too, as if that's all it does! Leave the program named pythondemo.If you wanna change the name set the new name in f.open("PythonDemo.py") , pythondemo being replaced with the new name...

I got most of the code from a token grabber, the project I used is here:

https://github.com/wodxgod/Discord-Token-Grabber/blob/master/token-grabber.py

(use of grabbers are against tos and aren't nice - don't use them xd)


make sure to get permission to join , after all , this forces them to do stuff without any actions on their side!

This is a demonstration, likely against discord tos so don't use
